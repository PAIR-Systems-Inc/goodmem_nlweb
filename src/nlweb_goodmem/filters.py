"""Safe construction of GoodMem metadata filter expressions.

GoodMem filters are expression strings evaluated server-side. Building one by
interpolating caller data straight into the string is an injection risk, so
these helpers quote values and refuse field names that cannot be expressed
safely.

``val()`` returns JSON, so a text comparison needs an explicit cast:
``CAST(val('$.category') AS TEXT) = 'feat'``.

Escaping was established against a live server (v1.0.320), not assumed. The
grammar escapes with a backslash: SQL-style ``''`` doubling and double-quoted
strings are both rejected with HTTP 400, and a raw newline inside a literal is
rejected outright.
