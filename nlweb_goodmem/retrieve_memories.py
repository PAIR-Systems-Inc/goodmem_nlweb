        Args:
            query: A natural language query used to find semantically similar
                memory chunks.
            space_ids: One or more space UUIDs to search across, separated by
                commas (e.g., 'id1,id2').
            max_results: Maximum number of matching chunks to return.
            include_memory_definition: Fetch the full memory metadata
                (source document info, processing status) alongside the
                matched chunks.
            wait_for_indexing: Poll for results when none come back on the
                first call. Enable this when memories were just added and may
                still be undergoing chunking and embedding.
            max_wait_seconds: Maximum time in seconds to poll for results when
                `wait_for_indexing` is enabled.
            poll_interval: Seconds to sleep between polling attempts when
                `wait_for_indexing` is enabled.
            reranker_id: UUID of a reranker model to refine the order of
                retrieved chunks via direct query-chunk scoring.
            llm_id: UUID of an LLM that will produce a contextual summary
                (`abstractReply`) over the retrieved chunks.
            relevance_threshold: Minimum relevance score (0-1) below which
                results are dropped. Only applied when a post-processor is
                configured.
            llm_temperature: Creativity setting for LLM generation (0-2).
                Only used when `llm_id` is also provided.
            chronological_resort: Reorder final results by creation time after
                reranking and thresholding.
            metadata_filter: SQL-style JSONPath expression applied server-side
                to narrow results by metadata. The same filter is attached to
                every space key in the request. Empty strings are ignored.
                Example: `CAST(val('$.category') AS TEXT) = 'feat'`.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments (unused).
